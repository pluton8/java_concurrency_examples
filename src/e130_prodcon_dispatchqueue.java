/**
 * A classical, simplified example of the producer and consumer pattern. Here a
 * Producer works in its own thread, produces a product every 100 ms., and
 * notifies about that its listener. The listener is a Consumer, which processes
 * the product.
 *
 * NOTA BENE: in this example, the listener's callback functions are called
 * asynchronously and explicitly on the specified DispatchQueue. (The
 * DispatchQueue class is a humble and very simple mock of the dispatch_queue_t
 * type in Apple's GCD library.) The serial queue implies that one of the
 * callbacks will not be called while another one is executing.
 *
 * How to stop the queue though? In a usual case, the Consumer doesn't care (?)
 * exactly which queue it's running in as long as it's the same one for every
 * invocation (to get rid of messy synchronization). Here, however, the Consumer
 * does know the exact instance to be able to asynchronously shutdown the queue
 * once all the products are processed. (It could be done in Producer, but
 * that's really not his responsibility, and it doesn't know if the queue is
 * needed after the whole process.) Maybe it's not the best decision, and the
 * main thread should be responsible for shutting down the queueâ€¦
