/**
 * Two threads are doing some job in pieces. Each one must give control to the
 * other one after doing its one piece of work. The wait()/notify() methods are
 * used on the same object to block when ready to do some work and unblock when
 * notified.
 *
 * Also, to give each thread a right to start first, every one sleeps for a
 * random amount of time (0â€¦5 ms.) before start.
